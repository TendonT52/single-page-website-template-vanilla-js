Group Generator Website

Group Generator is specially designed to help arrange the student group for doing class activities. Normally, the group was picked randomly to encourage students to work with new friends. But sometimes the outcome isn’t going well. There are some problems which our team sees such as it takes some time to get to know each others or unbalanced group (in term of skills/interest ex. website developing etc.) or even personal conflicts. This might be a personal issues, but it also affects all of other member in the group as well. So we have come up with a group generator website which includes the features to select friends they want or not want to be with. With our algorithm, it doesn’t always guarantee to let students stay with who they want, so there is still some randomness in it. We hope that with the group that was generated by our website, each student will still meet some new friends, but he/she will be more comfortable to work with them which will lead to better learning outcomes.
